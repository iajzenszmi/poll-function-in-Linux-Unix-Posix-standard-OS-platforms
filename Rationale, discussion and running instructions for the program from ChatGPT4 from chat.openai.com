a complete working demo of the Unix poll() function

To demonstrate the use of the poll() function in Unix, I'll create a simple example in C. The poll() function is used for monitoring multiple file descriptors to see if any of them is ready for some kind of I/O operation. It is often used in network programming or in situations where you need to handle multiple IO streams concurrently.

In this example, we will set up poll() to monitor standard input (stdin) for any incoming data. When the user types something and presses enter, the program will detect this and print a message.

Here's the code:

c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <poll.h>

#define TIMEOUT 5 // Time in seconds to wait

int main(void) {
    struct pollfd fds[1];
    int ret;

    // Set up the pollfd structure
    fds[0].fd = STDIN_FILENO; // Standard input
    fds[0].events = POLLIN;   // Check for input

    // Wait for up to TIMEOUT seconds for input
    ret = poll(fds, 1, TIMEOUT * 1000);

    if (ret == -1) {
        perror("poll");
        return 1;
    }

    if (!ret) {
        printf("%d seconds elapsed.\n", TIMEOUT);
        return 0;
    }

    if (fds[0].revents & POLLIN) {
        char buf[1024];
        int len = read(STDIN_FILENO, buf, sizeof(buf));
        if (len == -1) {
            perror("read");
            return 1;
        }

        if (len) {
            buf[len] = '\0';
            printf("Read: %s\n", buf);
        }

        return 0;
    }

    fprintf(stderr, "Unexpected condition.\n");
    return 1;
}

To compile and run this program, follow these steps:

    Save the Code: Save the code in a file, for example, poll_demo.c.
    Compile the Code: Use a C compiler like gcc to compile the code. Run gcc poll_demo.c -o poll_demo in your terminal.
    Run the Program: Execute the compiled program by typing ./poll_demo in your terminal.
    Test the Program: Once the program is running, you can type something and press enter to see the response. If you don't type anything, after 5 seconds (or the specified TIMEOUT), the program will time out.

This simple example demonstrates the basic use of poll() in monitoring stdin. You can extend this concept to monitor multiple file descriptors, such as sockets in network programming.
